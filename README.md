Bernie Filter
================================
A Chrome extension that removes Bernie Sanders from the Internet.


Overview
--------------------------
This is a fork of Rob Spectre's excellent [Trump Filter](https://github.com/RobSpectre/Trump-Filter) project.

[I am a Sanderista](https://medium.com/@vtcraghead/primary-2016-manifesto-b66690e6640a#.4ndm5jrcn). I make no apologies for that. But some of my friends in other camps have grown tired of the occasionally-overenthusiastic online activity of Bernie's supporters. They'd like a break from that, and I offer them this modified extension in exchange for their vote in the general when Bernie is the Democratic nominee :)


Features
--------------------------

* Detects instances of Bernie Sanders on web pages, warning users.
* Attempts to identify semantically sections of the page likely to contain Bernie references and removes them from the page.
* Sensitivity settings to customize the aggressiveness of the filter - remove single references, chunks or the entire page.


Installation (for Users)
--------------------------

Chrome extension soon to be in the web store


Installation (for Developers)
