Bernie Filter
================================
A Chrome extension that removes Bernie Sanders from the Internet.


Overview
--------------------------
This is a fork of Rob Spectre's excellent [Trump Filter](https://github.com/RobSpectre/Trump-Filter) project.

[I am a Sanderista](https://medium.com/@vtcraghead/primary-2016-manifesto-b66690e6640a#.4ndm5jrcn). I make no apologies for that. But some of my friends in other camps have grown tired of the occasionally-overenthusiastic online activity of Bernie's supporters. They'd like a break from that, and I offer them this modified extension in exchange for their vote in the general when Bernie is the Democratic nominee :)

_Note: for some reason Bernie's homepage is impervious to filtering this way. Maybe avoid that one unless you've caved and want to donate._


Features
--------------------------

* Detects instances of Bernie Sanders on web pages, warning users.
* Attempts to identify semantically sections of the page likely to contain Bernie references and removes them from the page.
* Sensitivity settings to customize the aggressiveness of the filter - remove single references, chunks or the entire page.


Installation (for Users)
--------------------------

1. [Download the package](Bernie-Filter.zip)
2. Extract it somewhere in your file system (remember where)
3. Open the Google Chrome settings and go to "More tools" --> "Extensions"
4. Check the "Developer mode" box
5. Click "Load unpacked extension"
6. Select the folder you extracted in step 2 above
7. Enjoy a (largely) Bernie-free browsing experience.
